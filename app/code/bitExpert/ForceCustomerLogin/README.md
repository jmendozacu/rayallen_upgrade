# Magento2 Force Frontend Customer Login Module 

The **Magento2** *Force Frontend Customer Login* Module redirects a storefront visitor to the Magento2 Frontend login page, 
if the visitor is not logged in. It is possible to configure the whitelisted urls to add custom definitions.

## Installation

The preferred way of installing `bitexpert/magento2-force-customer-login` is through Composer. Simply add `bitexpert/magento2-force-customer-login` 
as a dependency:

```
composer.phar require bitexpert/magento2-force-customer-login
```

## How to configure the module

### Navigation

Navigating through the *Magento 2* backend menu by clicking onto **Customers** you must see a new menu entry **Forced Login Whitelist**. 
Enter this menu entry.

### Overview Grid

You can add new entries by clicking on the *Add Entry* button in the upper right corner ( **1** ), [see below](#detail-form). 
The grid ( **2** ) contains all existing whitelisted *Url Rules*, for which the forced redirect to the *Customer Login Page* is omitted.
The *Url Rules* ( **3** ) are part of a regular expression checking on the called *Url* and tries to match against the whitelist.
*Url Rules* may be related to all stores or to a specific one ( **4** ). All rules except some mandatory ones are editable ( **5** ) and removeable ( **6** ).
