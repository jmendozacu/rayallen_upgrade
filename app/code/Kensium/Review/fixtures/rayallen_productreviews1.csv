RAK550,Rating,5,Sonny's in that house,"I received the Collapsible RAK550 very quickly and admittedly with some skepticism.I eased the crate from its rugged box and set it up with no problems needing only a common screwdriver for the side 90's. After a few minutes of careful scrutiny I began to marvel at its set-up, precise fit, venting with views, powder coat, and size as well as its inherent ease of transport. It will easily tolerate a ballistic sport dog from time to time and I must say that this crate is well worth the money. It is a welcome, handsome and durable addition to the place and I look forward to picking up another one.CCS",Conrad Carter,nearer@earthlink.net,08/09/12 12:59,Seattle,WA,United States,y

RAK500,Rating,4,RAM review,"I received the Kennel with damaged edges and after putting it together, it turned out to be a flimsy product. I expected a sturdy Kennel but I was wrong. Ray Allen blamed UPS for the damages. I don't feel safe to use for duty purposes and will use at home instead.",BB,bernardobarajas@verizon.net,16/09/12 19:56,Orange County,CA,United States,y
