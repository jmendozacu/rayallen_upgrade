RAK550,Rating,5,Sonny's in that house,"I received the Collapsible RAK550 very quickly and admittedly with some skepticism.I eased the crate from its rugged box and set it up with no problems needing only a common screwdriver for the side 90's. After a few minutes of careful scrutiny I began to marvel at its set-up, precise fit, venting with views, powder coat, and size as well as its inherent ease of transport. It will easily tolerate a ballistic sport dog from time to time and I must say that this crate is well worth the money. It is a welcome, handsome and durable addition to the place and I look forward to picking up another one.CCS",Conrad Carter,nearer@earthlink.net,08/09/12 12:59,Approved,Seattle,WA,United States

5160BK-P,Rating,5,Great customer service,"I've had two of these leads. The first one lasted over a year, through Schutzhund training and daily use in  sun and rain, until I managed to lose it on a night hike.Upon receiving the replacement lead I ordered, I noticed a serious flaw in the leather. After conditioning the leather and testing it with some weight (a 100 lb K9 pulling with all his might) the leash snapped. I have been sent a replacement, free of charge.You will definitely want to condition the leather.

30C-P,Rating,2,Sleeve portions for intermediate sleeves,"I'd simply like to note the cost of the lower portions of the intermediate sleeves with the built-up bite bars.  I think there is work to be done with these due to the poor longevity of that lower construction.  It seems to have the right density for a training sleeve but wears out wayyy too soon for the cost to replace it.  And because it is a dedicated lower unit, it calls for a limited possible selection to replace it.  Simply put, it $95.+ shipping every time it wears out and it wears out VERY easily.","Bob A,",luftwolf@cox.net,11/12/12 05:26,Approved,Oklahoma City,OK,United States

850R-P,Rating,2,"Great idea, but won't last long. ","I wish I could give this a higher rating, but within minutes of starting to play with my dog after installing one on his new Kong, it was halfway chewed through, in two spots, and he hadn't had 5 seconds with it that we weren't actively engaged. He managed to do the damage while coming back to me with it. I will say that he found it very entertaining, more so than just the Kong, and he was very excited. The rope is tough enough for tugging; I tied an extra knot in it and it worked great regardless of which of us had the rope vs. the Kong. I'd really like to find something like this that is as tough as the Kong Extreme, so that I don't have to keep replacing the ropes!",Jon Merrow,jemerrow@gmail.com,07/01/13 19:22,Approved,Norcross,GA,United States
RAK500,Rating,5,RAM 500,Very well built kennel.  Easy to assemble and seems like it will last forever.  Only complaint I have is the packaging.

I've used it for 2 days and found the provided clip is not strong enough to hold the camera on my uniform. The seat belt will pull it from my shirt and a minor scuffle last night resulted in the camera being pulled from my uniform.

Down side is its expensive I have no issue paying for quality but even for a good collar it's over priced. Prongs are dull and made to be worn and not irritate the dogs neck.

8748-P,Rating,5,Leather Alternative Leads,"I was first introduced to this lead by my dog's obedience trainer (a former K-9 trainer). Made of composite materials, it is much stronger/more durable than the leather or nylon leads in my opinion. Had two pups in training who chewed on the first and barely a scratch on it. My dog always carries his lead in his mouth and never a tooth mark! I have had the black lead for over a year now and it still looks brand new! I ordered the 6' coyote color for my GSD and it is just beautiful. I highly recommend these leads, and will never use anything other than the leather alternative.

It's strong when it stays closed, and nothing on this collar rusts, but the buckle can easily pop open when the collar rolls.  I've had it pop right off the dog.  I also don't like the rough melted end of the nylon strap on the dog's fur, but overall it's probably smoother on the fur than a standard leather collar.",Ben,ben@maulis.com,27/03/13 18:21,Approved,"Nevada, USA",NV,United States
HS500-P,Rating,3,"HS, but not the best","There's no question Sprenger makes the best chains and prong collars.  Here's what you need to know about this one: the black stainless has a rough texture that causes the links to bind instead of slipping.  Chrome is the slickest, and bright stainless is still much slicker than the black.  The nylon on this collar is very stiff and hard.  The buckle is like a ringsport suit buckle.",Ben,ben@maulis.com,27/03/13 18:24,Approved,"Nevada, USA",NV,United States
HS93-P,Rating,5,quality,"These are the best pinch/prong collars, except that the chrome version is possibly a little better.  The chrome version is plated with nickel that takes a far high level of polish, and then chromium that has much better lubricity than stainless.  The result is the links slide much nicer.  At some point the chrome will wear and the steel rust, whereas the stainless will last longer in this respect, but the stainless will dull much sooner than the chrome rusts, and need to be polished or just left dull looking if you don't care.  The chrome is much brighter to begin with and stays that way.  I've had both, but not the Curogan yet.",Ben,ben@maulis.com,27/03/13 18:32,Approved,"Nevada, USA",NV,United States
HS93-P,Rating,5,2.25 vs 3 or 4,"The 2.25mm has a smaller wire diameter and is therefore sharper.  It will also have more prongs on the neck.  Buy extra links for big dogs.  I have found my dog is more sensitive to the 2.25mm than to 3 or 4mm.  But 2.25 can bend under force so you must also have a back-up collar or harness if doing agitation or bitework.  The prong is used to steer the dog and for corrections, not to hold it.   The 2.25 may also be too short for very thick fur on some long hair GSD, but ideal for most Mali's and Dobermans for example.",Ben,ben@maulis.com,27/03/13 18:42,Approved,"Nevada, USA",NV,United States
8172P,Rating,2,"heavy, lots of hardware","This biothane type lead is very heavy.  The RAM-tech material seems quite a bit heavier than leather of the same size, but it stronger so you can use a 1/2 line for very strong dogs.  This lead is sized to match a leather lead in appearance, which means is is stronger and heavier than it needs to be.  It also has tons of hardware on it.  The thing I don't like is how when the lead goes from taught to slack, all that hardware smacks the dog's back.  The scissor snap here is HS and nickel-plated (not chrome-plated or stainless).  Compared to chrome it looks slightly yellowish instead of bluish.  The bolt snap is stainless.",Ben,ben@maulis.com,27/03/13 18:48,Approved,"Nevada, USA",NV,United States

HS92-P,Rating,4,quick release not necessary,"These are the nicest pinch collars, but the quick-release is not necessary unless you're a lady with long nails or something.  The links disconnect easily and in my opinion they are easier to connect than trying to hold the collar in place and use the scissor snap.  So save money and get the regular collar without the quick snap.  Do get a leash with the scissor snap though, they are great.",Ben,ben@maulis.com,10/04/13 14:46,Approved,"Nevada, USA",NV,United States
BB01B-P,Rating,3,Yes and no,"Great idea and concept, but still needs some refinement. The top and bottom halves don't seem to lock together very well, and leak all over the vehicle and cage when tipped slightly. The tab they have on the side to pull the halves apart should have a big sign that say chew me.  I would like to see a ring that goes around the circumference of the bowl to lock the edges together better. I paid the $16.99 plus $10 shipping in hopes of a bowl that would not leak when tipped. The design will do its job, but the sealing flaw that allows the bowl to leak at a 90 degree angle from the halves needs some help.

UA12240-P,Rating,4,Airy and comfortable out of the box!,"The Valsetz are a fantastic boot.  Sneaker comfortable right out of the box, but more importantly, sneaker LIGHT!  They're also extremely breathable which comes in handy during Virginia's hot and humid weather.  That said they have about zero water resistance, so be forewarned if that's a concern.  When I say zero, I mean the water dripping off your bottle will go straight through in an instant.I've run over a mile in them as well at a decent clip with no issue whatsoever.  Your grandfather's boots these are not.Admittedly I was a bit concerned as they looked narrow when I took them out of the box, but the toe box is nice and roomy width-wise.  No scrunched toes, yet a good heel cup that keeps you from sliding around.  If anything I'd say they run a half-size bigger than expected, but I prefer to order shoes on the slightly larger side to allow my toes to spread and feet to swell.Gripes are few, but I didn't give them 5 stars for two reasons: 1) They squeak like crazy.  You definitely won't be sneaking up on anyone...at least indoors.  Every footstep has the squeak of squishy rubber.  2) The top of the boot is a bit unforgiving and will dig into the sides of my ankles.  Perhaps this will lessen as they wear in, but can get annoying.Neither gripe would keep me from purchasing, again.

RAK550,Rating,4,K9 handler,I have been using this crate for 3 years now.  Overall it has been great - well built and my 'Houdini stays in it without any complaint.  I love that it collapses down to just the max airline luggage size where you don't have to pay over-size luggage fees.  Because I travel with mine a fair amount - I would love to see 'thumb screws' or similar so I didn't need to pack a screwdriver in the crate to put it together when I arrive at destination.  also TSA managed to not get it latched correctly after one flight so it doesn't always latch down as easy - so a little more durable mechanism there might help.  I love the small vents so dogs can't pull things into the crate - but it does make for less options for a crate-attached water dish.  Also love how light it is - despite the 'alcatraz' appearance it weighs less than a wire crate of the same size.,Denise,lcsar26@yahoo.com,03/04/14 22:40,Approved,RFL,CO,United States

3963-P,Rating,2,Great idea...poor execution,"I was really excited to try this out on my 58 pound female Malinois today for a short track, some bitework, and time on the A-frame to see how well it worked on a typically muggy, nasty Virginia evening.  Unfortunately I'm pretty disappointed in the effectiveness of these...rather overpriced...cooling pads.Initially I was impressed with the build quality, and fabric thickness.  The carriers will definitely hold up to some abuse.  The first fail was with a complete and total lack of instructions.  I had to look up the description of the KewlTech bed to determine the packs were to be frozen.  Fail number 2 is that the packs freeze SOLID.  Unlike a gel pack that stays pliable, these...again...overpriced packs freeze solid as ice, and don't fit into the carriers without folding them somewhat.  Which...surprise...doesn't allow them to sit flush against her body.  They'll bow out.  Not only that, but due to overlapping the buckle for her LLC harness, they're kept elevated off of her even farther, and the tension simply presses that large buckle into her side.Fail number 3 is the lack of velcro on the end.  Apparently there are some ENORMOUS dogs out there as I had to double over the velcro and had a 5 tab of material flopping about.  Nothing a bit of electrical tape or a velcro wrap can't fix, but...really?When I took her harness off I felt her sides to determine the effectiveness.  They were ever so slightly cooler than the rest of her body.  I mean...SLIGHTLY.  The cordura is not a good material to transfer the cool packs.  While it's welcome on the outside due to its abrasion resistance, a different, thinner material should've been used against the dog.Given that it's the only option available, I'm hesitant to return it, but I'll be experimenting with different, better designed ice packs.  For $100 this is a ridiculously poorly designed product, however.  2 stars (as I can't do 1.5) due to durability, and compatibility with the harness as well as a SOMEWHAT effective transfer of temperature.Improvements: - Better rear strap/velcro design (or include a piece to wrap up the double-overed end most of us will end up with.- More pliable cooling packs THAT ACTUALLY FIT when frozen.- Put a velcro strip (2x8 or 2x10) on the outside of the packs for ID strips.- Lower the price to something a bit more realistic...especially if improvements aren't made.",Casey A.,k9rescue@centurylink.net,11/06/14 18:51,Approved,Front Royal,VA,United States

For 15+ years old, I would consider that very good! It is very clear that the main goals for this muzzle where longevity, strength, Safety, and most importantly Comfort of the dog.

THR2-P,Rating,3,Not Adapted for Male Dogs,"Let me start with why I gave this review the title I did.  This harness is VERY long and of the male dogs I've tried the RAPTOR harnesses on, many of them end up peeing on the harnesses, due to their groins getting tucked under the harness.  I mean, you can just check to make sure the junk isn't caught when putting it on, but for some male dogs, it can still be noticeably uncomfortable for them to wear the harness as it pinches the skin before their man parts if the harness doesn't fit that particular dog's body style.Next thing I want to note is the quality of the straps on these harnesses.  Maybe it is because each harness I have gotten are old models and were made by Signature K9 (the tags are the dead give away) - I honestly don't know if the RAM-made harness straps are any better, but they fray VERY easily with use on surfaces such as: concrete or pavement while training.  (Think of the dog running, you tell him to down, he does, and the abrasive surfaces just eat away at the materials for the straps.)  In other words, the straps look pretty rough after about 3 weeks of daily training in an urban environment.The nice thing about this harness is that it has so much you can add to it from MOLLE panels, flotation panels, pouches, patches, cameras, and so forth.The reason I got the RAPTOR harnesses?  I won't deny it, part of it is for the aesthetics of the harness.  They are very form fitting as you can adjust how and where it fits on a dog.  When it is properly fitted on a dog, the dog is pretty oblivious to the harness - they just move normally without needing much conditioning to the harness. (of course, every dog is an individual, but I digress...)This harness is very sturdy, has excellent ventilation, and a very good harness for dogs that will be doing any aquatic work.  The harness doesn't hold onto that excess water weight that other harnesses I've used have - so it makes it a little easier on the dog to do their job or to train.Overall a decent harness.  For a tactical harness similar to this one, you are looking at over double the cost.  So if you want to get your feet wet with a nice tactical harness, this is the one.  Not great or perfect, but still nice harnesses.",Kassandra,better_germanblues@yahoo.com,13/02/16 01:53,Approved,Sheboygan,WI,United States
M3911-P,Rating,5,All Around Awesome!,"Allow me to preface first by saying: Mesh muzzles are not appropriate for every situation when working with dogs.  They can prohibit a dog's ability to cool themselves (panting) when compared to that of a basket muzzle.  Anyway, allow me to continue with this specific muzzle review.I wanted a muzzle that would actually fit my dog.  I have a working line Australian Shepherd and we like to refer to his nose as a beak due to it being long and slender.I have a wire basket muzzle for him from a different site and it just doesn't fit right.  He's not the kind of working dog that does muzzle fighting, or is aggressive towards anything, etc. he's just an assistance dog / service dog.  So I wanted something that was a little easier to pack for travel and still match the rest of his working gear.  Well, I had noticed that this muzzle is also adjustable around the beak so I figured I would give it a shot.Results?  For a dog that has only had very basic muzzle conditioning with basket muzzles, he actually was comfortable enough to play and sleep in this muzzle.  Of course, this all happened in the matter of 20 minutes during the middle of winter in Wisconsin, USA - so him staying cool wasn't a concern and he was supervised the entire time.  But the fact that he was /that/ comfortable wearing the muzzle that he didn't try to paw it off the whole time was a huge bonus.  The material is also of good working quality; another reason I wanted to give these muzzles a try rather than wasting money on those really cheap blue or black grooming mesh muzzles you see in the average pet store.  (They have their place, but not in my house.)  So I was really pleased with the quality of materials and the build of this muzzle.I would absolutely recommend these muzzles to working and sport dog handlers.",Kassandra,better_germanblues@yahoo.com,13/02/16 02:17,Approved,Sheboygan,WI,United States

I was skeptical at first because there is only 2 rivets holding on the handle, but a dog reactive Mastiff and me can agree that it is on there for good. Unlike other collars of this type, the handle will swivel down flat when the dog rolls on it's back.

ZY1200RI,Rating,5,Excellent for dry or itchy skin,"I have a GSD service dog. She gets brushed at least twice a day and washed pretty often, and she also has pretty sensitive skin. I have had a lot of issues after baths with her being very itchy and her skin irritated. I had even tried just rinsing, no soap, just in case bad rinsing was the problem. However, nothing seemed to help except just waiting a few days after a bath she wouldn't be so itchy. This conditioning rinse solved the problem immediately. I can wash her every other day if need be (sometimes in the winter, that is the case) and she never itches and her skin isn't irritated. You can also use this as a leave-in type of conditioner, which I usually do, since my girl has such sensitive skin, and it leaves her fur really shiny and soft.
